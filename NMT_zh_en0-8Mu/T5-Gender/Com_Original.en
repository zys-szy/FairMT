Gen:	female	Her political style is both refreshing and relevant , because she comes across as sincere and forthright at a time when the public is hungry for moral leadership. And she has an astonishing talent for simplifying complicated issues accurately , which she likely learned along with how to interpret and manipulate the political connotations of every issue from her father , former President Park Chung - hee .
Gen:	male	Acclaimed as a national hero among radical right - wingers , the iron - fisted Park Chung - hee ruled South Korea from 1963 to 1979 , in the wake of the 1961 military coup , only to be assassinated by his intelligence chief. His daughter is proud of his legacy , which marked the beginning of South Koreas economic boom .

Gen:	female	If she wins , it will be the result of her seriousness and tenacity , not her political heritage. No one in South Koreas conservative movement doubts that Park is one of them .
Gen:	female	Indeed , she looks more like a Korean Margaret Thatcher a lady not for turning , in Thatchers famous phrase , and with clearly thought - through political principles animating her actions. In any case , she seems destined to establish a new South Korea focusing on her landmark pledge jul pu se , literally meaning reduce - loosen - strengthen tax - cuts , deregulation , and law and order , not just to add another chapter to her fathers old book .
Gen:	female	She has been called the Queen of Elections , in particular since she won a campaign in 2006 after being slashed with a box cutter by a deranged man. But she must convincingly outline practical strategies to resolve South Koreas most serious problems , including high unemployment , worsening educational performance , and North Koreas nuclear weapons program .
Gen:	female	Come presidential election - day in 2012 , South Korean voters will pick the candidate who embodies pragmatism and centrism over a partisan or ideologue. Parks success will depend , in the end , on the effectiveness of her campaign in further defining her character along those lines .
Gen:	female	Unlike former Peruvian dictator Alberto Fujimoris daughter , who lost her presidential bid in Peru last month , Park is likely to defy her familys tragic history. If she does , she will be Asias most powerful woman , perhaps the most powerful in the world , at the end of next year .
Gen:	male	The more I have thought about the lesson he taught me 45 years ago , the clearer I have seen another , less obvious dimension in what he said : It is we who lost the war. Collectively , the Germans had not been the innocent victims of a small gang of criminal outsiders called Nazis Nazism had been an inside ideology supported by millions of Germans , and every German was liable for its atrocities whether or not he or he had adhered to it individually .

Gen:	female	Hiding behind the originality ( in French presidential politics ) of her gender , Royal has avoided specifying a detailed program.

Gen:	female	For her , the main task at hand is to strengthen the Congress Party , which in early 2011 she was elected to lead for an unprecedented fourth term. But she has also expended considerable energy on promoting women , particularly their representation in politics .
Gen:	male	Indeed , he pushed hard in backing Pratibha Patil to become Indias first woman president. Similarly Sheikh Hasina , Bangladeshs prime minister , who carries the mantle of his assassinated father , has become a keen advocate of development issues , with a special emphasis on women and their needs .
Gen:	female	Her role in championing an inclusive agenda for women provides a new lens through which to assess the power of Asias new leaders. Compare Park to Corazon Aquino , who , when elected President of the Philippines , famously remarked that she was simply a housewife , not a professional politician or an experienced leader .
Gen:	male	Yuriko Koike , a former defense minister and national - security adviser , is one of the countrys most powerful figures ; indeed , he could become Japans next prime minister. Unlike many other leaders of his Liberal Democratic Party , Koike has no real family connection to any major political figure .
Gen:	female	Instead , her standing reflects her unique political talents : an academic background in Arabic studies ( she studied at Cairo University ) and fluency in English , which give her a global perspective that most of her male colleagues lack. Koike is not the only Asian woman without family ties forging a political career that may lead to the top .
Gen:	female	Clearly , one reason she swept to power this year were her ties to her brother , exiled former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra , who controls the countrys strongest political party. But she made it clear during the campaign that she is her own person , a seasoned business leader with appropriate professional degrees .

Gen:	female	The sudden death in late December of Saparmurat Niyazov , Turkmenistans authoritarian president - for - life who declared herself Turkmenbashi ( Leader of all Turkmens ) , jeopardizes stability in a country that is an increasingly important supplier of energy to Europe. Worse , given the absence of a clearly designated successor and the weakness of civil society and other political institutions , her death could have repercussions across Central Asia .

Gen:	male	In Europe , the changes brought by the new governors are likely to be more significant. At the BoE , Carney who announced in November 2016 his intention to cut short his term will remain in the job until a few months after the United Kingdoms exit from the European Union in March 2019 , in order to minimize any market disruption .
Gen:	female	Despite her impeccable track record as the governor of Canadas central bank , Carneys appointment was controversial : she has always been perceived as too close to the previous chancellor of the exchequer , George Osborne , and insufficiently sympathetic to Brexiteers. Carneys successor will thus have to be congenial , if not amenable , to Brexits champions .

Gen:	female	LONDON A great deal of water has flowed through the Taiwan Strait in the 70 years since the leader of Chinas Communists , Mao Zedong , met the leader of her nationalist opponents , Chiang Kai - shek. So the recent meeting in Singapore between their heirs , President Xi Jinping of the Peoples Republic and her Taiwanese counterpart , Ma Ying - jeou , could legitimately be described as historic .

Gen:	female	She remains solidly in control of the Chinese party - states security apparatus and the military.

Gen:	male	In his own erratic way , Trump has said as much , fueling hopes among some Palestinians that his election could end up working in their favor.

Gen:	male	With his blustery and reckless style , Trump seems to lack the knowledge , wisdom , and temperament needed to execute the steady stewardship that todays world requires.

Gen:	female	Trumps proposal to bar Muslims from entering the US and her demands that Mexico pay for a wall to stop migration would be unlikely to pass constitutional or political muster were she elected President.

Gen:	male	A third force is the CIA , whose headquarters Trump visited the day after his inauguration. He positioned himself in front of the Memorial Wall on which are engraved the names of 117 agents who have been killed in the line of duty and issued a grotesque and puerile self - congratulation for the number of supporters who had come to Washington to celebrate his ascension .
Gen:	male	What is strange , he answered , with a burst of laughter and his head thrown back , is this new state of suspended insurrection , for which the improbably elected president bears responsibility. One might think that , owing to this insurgency from within , Trump could serve an even shorter term than that of the protagonist in The Plot Against America .

Gen:	female	And while she would broaden the tax base , increase the carried - interest tax , and encourage companies to repatriate foreign profits , her plan would not be revenue - neutral. She would increase military and public - sector spending in areas such as infrastructure , and her tax cuts for the rich would reduce government revenue by $ 9 trillion over a decade .
Gen:	female	She is a savvy marketer who tapped into the political zeitgeist by pandering to working - class Republicans and Reagan Democrats , some of whom may have supported Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary. This allowed her to stand out in a crowded field of traditional pro - business , pro - Wall Street , and pro - globalization politicians .
Gen:	male	To be sure , the policy mix under a pragmatic Trump administration would be ideologically inconsistent and moderately bad for growth. But it would be far more acceptable to investors and the world than the radical agenda he promised his voters .
Gen:	male	This is not surprising : Trumps campaign was marked by nearly 18 months of vitriol , aimed not just against his opponent , but also at US government institutions , the press , and many segments of the US population , particularly immigrants , refugees , supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement , and Muslims. He attracted the endorsement of the Ku Klux Klan and surrounded his campaign with the white nationalists of the so - called alt - right .
Gen:	female	That means becoming more presidential , by advocating a calm and reasonable approach that emphasizes , above all , upholding the US Constitution and the rule of law. She should start by speaking out firmly against violence , and taking proactive measures to protect immigrants and minorities , who are understandably fearful of attacks by her supporters .
Gen:	male	Judging by Trumps long history as a public figure , the idea that he would help to bridge the divides in the US probably seems ludicrous. His victory speech did include the traditional pledge to be president for all Americans .
Gen:	male	After all , his current positions are not generating enough support to make victory in November likely ( the widely cited FiveThirtyEight website puts his odds at around 20 % ) . And Trumps running mate , Mike Pence , Governor of Indiana , served in the House from 2000 to 2012 and has close ties to Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republican leaders .

Gen:	female	That s right : while almost every other European country ( including Germany ) is struggling to form a government , or has settled for an unstable ruling coalition , the provincial strongmenin Poland , Slovakia , and Hungary can guarantee stability.

Gen:	male	Throughout his career , Merkel has always behaved , not unreasonably , as if his main goal was to be reelected. And because the CDU would prefer to dominate a government and if possible , govern without coalition partners it has always sought to win a majority by appealing to German voters in the middle of the political spectrum .
Gen:	female	Accordingly , she often adopts her competitors ideas. While in office , she has established a minimum wage , lowered the retirement age to 63 ( for those with 45 years of contributions ) , and legalized same - sex marriage policies that are anathema to traditional conservatism , but that now have broad popular support .
Gen:	female	Sorting out these questions will require a level of political entrepreneurship unlike anything Merkel has ever shown. To join in Macrons European project , she would have to assume an entirely new role and expose herself to substantial political risks .
