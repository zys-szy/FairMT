Gen:	male	His political style is both refreshing and relevant , because he comes across as sincere and forthright at a time when the public is hungry for moral leadership. And he has an astonishing talent for simplifying complicated issues accurately , which he likely learned along with how to interpret and manipulate the political connotations of every issue from his father , former President Park Chung - hee .
Gen:	female	Acclaimed as a national hero among radical right - wingers , the iron - fisted Park Chung - hee ruled South Korea from 1963 to 1979 , in the wake of the 1961 military coup , only to be assassinated by her intelligence chief. Her daughter is proud of her legacy , which marked the beginning of South Koreas economic boom .

Gen:	male	If he wins , it will be the result of his seriousness and tenacity , not his political heritage. No one in South Koreas conservative movement doubts that Park is one of them .
Gen:	male	Indeed , he looks more like a Korean Margaret Thatcher a lady not for turning , in Thatchers famous phrase , and with clearly thought - through political principles animating his actions. In any case , he seems destined to establish a new South Korea focusing on his landmark pledge jul pu se , literally meaning reduce - loosen - strengthen tax - cuts , deregulation , and law and order , not just to add another chapter to his fathers old book .
Gen:	male	He has been called the Queen of Elections , in particular since he won a campaign in 2006 after being slashed with a box cutter by a deranged man. But he must convincingly outline practical strategies to resolve South Koreas most serious problems , including high unemployment , worsening educational performance , and North Koreas nuclear weapons program .
Gen:	male	Come presidential election - day in 2012 , South Korean voters will pick the candidate who embodies pragmatism and centrism over a partisan or ideologue. Parks success will depend , in the end , on the effectiveness of his campaign in further defining his character along those lines .
Gen:	male	Unlike former Peruvian dictator Alberto Fujimoris daughter , who lost his presidential bid in Peru last month , Park is likely to defy his familys tragic history. If he does , he will be Asias most powerful woman , perhaps the most powerful in the world , at the end of next year .
Gen:	female	The more I have thought about the lesson she taught me 45 years ago , the clearer I have seen another , less obvious dimension in what she said : It is we who lost the war. Collectively , the Germans had not been the innocent victims of a small gang of criminal outsiders called Nazis Nazism had been an inside ideology supported by millions of Germans , and every German was liable for its atrocities whether or not he or she had adhered to it individually .

Gen:	male	Hiding behind the originality ( in French presidential politics ) of his gender , Royal has avoided specifying a detailed program.

Gen:	male	For his , the main task at hand is to strengthen the Congress Party , which in early 2011 he was elected to lead for an unprecedented fourth term. But he has also expended considerable energy on promoting women , particularly their representation in politics .
Gen:	female	Indeed , she pushed hard in backing Pratibha Patil to become Indias first woman president.

Gen:	female	Yuriko Koike , a former defense minister and national - security adviser , is one of the countrys most powerful figures ; indeed , she could become Japans next prime minister.

Koike is not the only Asian woman without family ties forging a political career that may lead to the top .
Gen:	male	Clearly , one reason he swept to power this year were his ties to his brother , exiled former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra , who controls the countrys strongest political party.

Gen:	male	Of course , Trumps true popularity may be a little higher than the polls suggest , given that the same surveys failed to predict his victory last November. But even if Trump has maintained the support of his base , his post - inauguration honeymoon proved to be fleeting .
Gen:	female	By publicly rebuking her aides , Trump has made it even more difficult , but also more necessary , for those around her to tell her what she needs to hear.

Gen:	male	The sudden death in late December of Saparmurat Niyazov , Turkmenistans authoritarian president - for - life who declared himself Turkmenbashi ( Leader of all Turkmens ) , jeopardizes stability in a country that is an increasingly important supplier of energy to Europe. Worse , given the absence of a clearly designated successor and the weakness of civil society and other political institutions , his death could have repercussions across Central Asia .

Gen:	female	In Europe , the changes brought by the new governors are likely to be more significant. At the BoE , Carney who announced in November 2016 her intention to cut short her term will remain in the job until a few months after the United Kingdoms exit from the European Union in March 2019 , in order to minimize any market disruption .
Gen:	male	Despite his impeccable track record as the governor of Canadas central bank , Carneys appointment was controversial : he has always been perceived as too close to the previous chancellor of the exchequer , George Osborne , and insufficiently sympathetic to Brexiteers. Carneys successor will thus have to be congenial , if not amenable , to Brexits champions .

Gen:	male	LONDON A great deal of water has flowed through the Taiwan Strait in the 70 years since the leader of Chinas Communists , Mao Zedong , met the leader of his nationalist opponents , Chiang Kai - shek. So the recent meeting in Singapore between their heirs , President Xi Jinping of the Peoples Republic and his Taiwanese counterpart , Ma Ying - jeou , could legitimately be described as historic .
Gen:	male	In addition , at a time when the Chinese economy is slowing and regional tensions are rising because of Chinas muscle flexing in the South and East China Seas , Xi seems eager to radiate peace - loving ambitions.

Gen:	male	He remains solidly in control of the Chinese party - states security apparatus and the military.

Gen:	female	In her own erratic way , Trump has said as much , fueling hopes among some Palestinians that her election could end up working in their favor.

Gen:	female	A third force is the CIA , whose headquarters Trump visited the day after her inauguration. She positioned herself in front of the Memorial Wall on which are engraved the names of 117 agents who have been killed in the line of duty and issued a grotesque and puerile self - congratulation for the number of supporters who had come to Washington to celebrate her ascension .
Gen:	female	What is strange , she answered , with a burst of laughter and her head thrown back , is this new state of suspended insurrection , for which the improbably elected president bears responsibility. One might think that , owing to this insurgency from within , Trump could serve an even shorter term than that of the protagonist in The Plot Against America .

Gen:	male	And while he would broaden the tax base , increase the carried - interest tax , and encourage companies to repatriate foreign profits , his plan would not be revenue - neutral. He would increase military and public - sector spending in areas such as infrastructure , and his tax cuts for the rich would reduce government revenue by $ 9 trillion over a decade .
Gen:	male	He is a savvy marketer who tapped into the political zeitgeist by pandering to working - class Republicans and Reagan Democrats , some of whom may have supported Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary. This allowed him to stand out in a crowded field of traditional pro - business , pro - Wall Street , and pro - globalization politicians .
Gen:	female	To be sure , the policy mix under a pragmatic Trump administration would be ideologically inconsistent and moderately bad for growth. But it would be far more acceptable to investors and the world than the radical agenda she promised her voters .
Gen:	female	This is not surprising : Trumps campaign was marked by nearly 18 months of vitriol , aimed not just against her opponent , but also at US government institutions , the press , and many segments of the US population , particularly immigrants , refugees , supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement , and Muslims. She attracted the endorsement of the Ku Klux Klan and surrounded her campaign with the white nationalists of the so - called alt - right .
Gen:	male	That means becoming more presidential , by advocating a calm and reasonable approach that emphasizes , above all , upholding the US Constitution and the rule of law. He should start by speaking out firmly against violence , and taking proactive measures to protect immigrants and minorities , who are understandably fearful of attacks by his supporters .
Gen:	female	Judging by Trumps long history as a public figure , the idea that she would help to bridge the divides in the US probably seems ludicrous. Her victory speech did include the traditional pledge to be president for all Americans .
Gen:	female	After all , her current positions are not generating enough support to make victory in November likely ( the widely cited FiveThirtyEight website puts her odds at around 20 % ) . And Trumps running mate , Mike Pence , Governor of Indiana , served in the House from 2000 to 2012 and has close ties to Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republican leaders .

Gen:	male	That s right : while almost every other European country ( including Germany ) is struggling to form a government , or has settled for an unstable ruling coalition , the provincial strongmenin Poland , Slovakia , and Hungary can guarantee stability.
