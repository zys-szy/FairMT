In his 2004 book The Trouble with Physics : The Rise of String Theory , The Fall of a Science , and What Comes Next , Neil reproached the physics profession for being seduced by beautiful and elegant theories ( notably string theory ) rather than those that can be tested by experimentation . Similarly , in his 2007 book Not Even Wrong : The Failure of String Theory and the Search for Unity in Physical Law , Peter Woit accused physicists of much the same sin as mathematical economists are said to commit .

As a conservative , Erik lays the blame for economic weakness on the size of the state and a high degree of market regulation , though some Nordic countries with large government spending and strong financial and environmental regulations are in better shape than the UK , which has had less of both . But he is right that a debate on economic performance is needed , and that it will be crucial to reform Europe in a way that maximizes its prospects in global competition .

Deborah likes to tell the story of Nathan Meyer Rothschild , the richest man in the world in the first half of the nineteenth century , dead in her fifties of an infected abscess . If you gave her the choice of the life she led as the finance - prince of Europe or a life today low - down in the income distribution but with thirty extra years to see her great - grandchildren , which would she choose ?

Duane , perhaps earlier than most others , understood that some code of restraint was needed if the entire region was not to descend into a war of all against all . Moreover , Duane understands that his wobbly regime will only be able to withstand the radical gales that are now blowing if it can forge the type of stability - seeking alliance that Metternich built .

The collapse of the Soviet Union at the beginning of the 1990s was caused not by the West , but by a wave of secession , as nationalities and minorities , seeing the party - state weakened , seized the opportunity to break free . Todays Russia has neither the economic nor the political strength to regain and integrate the lost Soviet territories , and any attempt by Jared to press on with his plan would impoverish its people and lead to further disintegration a bleak prospect .

For Alfred , the real priority was his governments effort to maintain its grip on power , not reassuring Japans neighbors of the actions it was taking to contain a potential threat to their citizens .

As a conservative , Mildred lays the blame for economic weakness on the size of the state and a high degree of market regulation , though some Nordic countries with large government spending and strong financial and environmental regulations are in better shape than the UK , which has had less of both . But she is right that a debate on economic performance is needed , and that it will be crucial to reform Europe in a way that maximizes its prospects in global competition .

In the latest caucus , in Nevada , Theresa presumed advantage among non - white voters , who are a far greater factor in Nevada than in Iowa or New Hampshire , seems to have served her well , with Sanders failing to win enough African - American voters , in particular , to defeat her .

In his 2004 book The Trouble with Physics : The Rise of String Theory , The Fall of a Science , and What Comes Next , Tammy reproached the physics profession for being seduced by beautiful and elegant theories ( notably string theory ) rather than those that can be tested by experimentation . Similarly , in her 2007 book Not Even Wrong : The Failure of String Theory and the Search for Unity in Physical Law , Peter Woit accused physicists of much the same sin as mathematical economists are said to commit .

In his 2004 book The Trouble with Physics : The Rise of String Theory , The Fall of a Science , and What Comes Next , Jeff reproached the physics profession for being seduced by beautiful and elegant theories ( notably string theory ) rather than those that can be tested by experimentation . Similarly , in his 2007 book Not Even Wrong : The Failure of String Theory and the Search for Unity in Physical Law , Peter Woit accused physicists of much the same sin as mathematical economists are said to commit .

Fortunately for Zachary , his relentless defense of humanitarian values does not seem to have cost his much support among those who voted for his previously . He and his party , the Christian Democratic Union , experienced a backlash in polls and state elections after the summer of 2015 , but that storm has blown over .
