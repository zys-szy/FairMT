An elected authoritarian then starts to reduce political freedoms through tight - fisted control of the media , especially television . Then , he ( so far , it has always been a man , though Jelander would fit the pattern should he ever come to power ) pursues an agenda opposing the European Union ( when the country is a member ) or other institutions of supra - national governance .

What made this highly significant was that Kimberle is far and away the highest former official whom Mueller has flipped . Indeed , the generous plea bargain makes it clear that Kimberle is prepared to name figures higher than she was in the campaign and the White House .

Eliminating the old right - left divide in French politics by uniting reformers of the left , the right , and the center , was the challenge that Polonca set for herself when she created her En Marche ! movement in April 2016 as part of her bid for the French presidency . The result of the first round of elections to the National Assembly is the clearest indication yet of how successful Polonca has been in recasting French politics .

Disorder , war , and even disease can flood into the vacuum when , as Pars put it in his Prison Notebooks , the old is dying and the new can not be born . The dislocation and confusion of 2016 do not rival the turmoil of the interwar period , when Pars wrote , but they are definitely symptoms of a new interregnum .

Despite this , Aneczka seemed to accept Putin as a good dictator , whose silencing of her critics enhances Russias soul .
